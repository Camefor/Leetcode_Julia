Advice from ex-Google intern, Amzon-intern - July 22, 2020, one of my mock interviewers in July 2020.<br> [Stonyan Biner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stoyanbinev/) shared his advice through Linkedin.com. 
<br><br><br>
No. 1 [System design](https://github.com/shashank88/system_design)<br>
No. 2 [System design - Harvard CS 76](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview)<br>
No. 3 [System design primer][https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer<br>



The first one gives a brief overview of how the interview will go and the kinds of topics covered. I would suggest reading through but not spending much time on the blogs provides as you would like to focus on pure preparation. If you have the time, check out the Harvard CS76 course mentioned but pick out the lectures specifically on scalability. <br>

The 2nd one has the most examples of interview scenarios, read through to get the type of stuff that would be presented and tasks that await.<br>

The last one is the major one, this would give you the complete training for this kind of interview. I highly suggest you go through the whole repo on this one, there even are flashcards to train questions and topics.<br>

**Interviewing.io** <br>
For seeing the interview live, check out the system design recordings on interviewing.io, there is a section with recorded system design interviews, focus on the ones done by Googlers first and then the other ones.<Br>

To practise, the interviewing website doesn't have free system design interviews so if you don't want to spend a lot of money it's not a good choice, if you want to practise for free check out Pramp, it has free interviews but keep in mind it's free entry so it's not guaranteed to be a high quality interview.<br>

I know you are active on leetcode, so I would suggest checking out the system design section there and specifically the discussions, people usually share past interviews.<br>

There is a book called Elements of Programming Interviews, if you have the time left look into the system design section, I remember this was one of the more elaborate books on interview processes.

Good luck and let me know how it went!<br>

**Actionable items:**<br>
1. Harvard CS76 course<br>
2. The system design recordings on interviewing.io - showcase, Googler ones first<br>
3. The system design section on Leetcode.com<br>
4. Elements of programming interviews - system design section <br>
