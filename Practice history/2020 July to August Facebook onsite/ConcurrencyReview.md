Concurrency basics: threads, processes, threading in the language you know. Locks , mutex etc.<br>

I like to spend a few hours to review the concurrency topics for system design.<br>

[MIT - 6.005 - Software Construction](http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa14/classes/17-concurrency/) Reading 17: Concurrency<br>

Objectives: <br>
Message passing & shared memory<br>
Processess & threads<br>
Time slicing<br>
Race conditions<br>

Lecture notes from Colorado university. [Introduction concurrency](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~kena/classes/5828/f14/lectures/04-introconcurrency.pdf) <br>

Take a break, study the case study from concurrency book, 15.1 Combinatorial systems: rules and tactics, page 424. <br>
