[Understanding the EAV data model and when to use it](https://inviqa.com/blog/understanding-eav-data-model-and-when-use-it)<br>

I went through the basics, and then google the keyword and find some articles to read:<br>

**DB basics: types of DB's (SQL vs noSQL etc ), hashing and indexing, EAV based databases, Sharding, caching for databases, master-slave etc**<br>

Master-slave databases - <br>

Networking basics: Should know the TCP/IP stack, basics of how Internet, HTTP, TCP/IP work at the minimum. cs75 on youtube (1st lecture) should give a broad overview. I personally love networking-a top down approach.<br>

My job is to go over the network top down book version 7, 2017. I like to spend a few hours to study, and also take some notes. <br>
Best candidate should enjoy reading time - network used to be my research area. I did not have chance to review content and I do like to see how good the text book can be written, how those network area research helps to advance teaching. <br>

I love to see those case studies of Netflix, and update on application layer. <br>

2.6.4 Case Studies: Netflix, YouTube, and Kankan<br>

Netflix embodies many of the key principles discussed earlier in this section, including adaptive
streaming and CDN distribution. However, because Netflix uses its own private CDN, which distributes
only video (and not Web pages), Netflix has been able to simplify and tailor its CDN design.<br>

I spent a few hours to read application layer protocols. I also like to find very short and good lecture notes on this topic.<br>

Work on content from [tianpan.com system design](https://tianpan.co/notes/2016-02-13-crack-the-system-design-interview)<br>
I watched the tech talk on TAO data store over 10 times, and it took me two to three days to understand architecture. The most important is to build strong interest to learn and understand the challenge of the problem solving. <br>
