It is so surprising that I got offer to have onsite interview with Google first time in my life. <br>
I started to work on system design again, and also more algorithm practice.<br> 
727 minimum window subsequence <br>
[My first practice](https://github.com/jianminchen/Leetcode_Julia/blob/master/Practice%20history/2020%20November%20Google%20onsite/algorithms/727%20minimum%20subsequence.cs)<br>

I made decision to purchase Leetcode premium for one year subscription. I like to finish 14 set of Google mock onsite interview algorithms first. <br>

Feedback is typically broken down into four categories (Analytical Ability, Coding, Experience, and Communication) and you are given a score from 1.0 to 4.0 overall, where 2.8 is the threshold of hire vs. no-hire. Interviewer feedback is collated and sent to a hiring committee, which ultimately decides whether to move forward with an offer, reject the candidate.<br>
If your average score is below 2.8 then the feedback is not even forwarded to the hiring committee and you receive a rejection.<br>
