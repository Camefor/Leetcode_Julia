I am preparing for Google phone screen. I like to work on more algorithms and write code continuously. Ideas like weekend coding marathon, week day coding marathon, system design on pramp.com, mock interviews on interviewing.io. <br>

I also like to learn from lessons from Microsoft phone screen, and also Facebook phone screen and onsite experience as well. <br>
