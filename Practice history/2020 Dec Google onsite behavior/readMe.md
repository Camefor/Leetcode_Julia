It is structured in 4 parts:<br>
A. Mission & Ten things we know to be true (Google’s 10 Core Values / Leadership Principles)<br>
1. Focus on the user and all else will follow.<br>
2. It’s best to do one thing really, really well.<br>
3. Fast is better than slow.<br>
4. Democracy on the web works<br>
5. You don’t need to be at your desk to need an answer.<br>
6. You can make money without doing evil.<br>
7. There’s always more information out there.<br>
8. The need for information crosses all borders.<br>
9. You can be serious without a suit.<br>
10. Great just isn’t good enough.<br>

B. Two most important things in a recruit, behavioral questions and how to prepare (STAR method)<br>
Googleyness. The first thing they measure here is cognitive ability, for example, they’ll ask you: Tell me about a tough problem you solved, how did you solve me, walk me through it.<br>
Preparation: 5 stories (full story + shortened into: situation, task, actions, result) + 3 x answers to 20 most common behavioral questions - examples in the video<br>

But one more highlight here in terms of leadership - or at least one more interesting keyword - is emergent leadership. I noticed various Google HR leaders referincing it throughout the years; whta does this mean: it’s essentially your ability to step in when there is a peoblem and step out when they are no longer needed. Would be great if you could also make this stand out in one of your prepared stories.<br>

Sales or posted invoice/ open order/ BOM/ Cost analysis <br>
Tough problems - 5 stories <br>
**First story**<br>
1. Net sales -> work on net sales formula, CAD/ USA, net sale formula, commission, overhead, split commission, shared by multiple agents - C# programming - <br>
Enterprise database -> my own database on database server <br>
2. Second steps: Write 7 SQL script, readMe, how to document, add region information, fiscal year/ month sale, categorize the item - build a dictionary to map BOM to product - over 500 lines of SQL script<br>
Excel sheet - powerpivot -> first access directly -> concern the available user limit -> slow down the system, big size of Excel sheet -> hard to refresh -> convert to C# programming<br>
3. Last 10 years, condition format -> sales amount/ quantity<br>
1. 2010 - 2011, the report can adapt to change quickly in less than a few minutes, and reports are generated visually. - analysis and reporting - Technology: Excel, pivot, SQL script, Excel features. Before weeks - Windows Form application -> Excel sheet - powerpviot - loading 10 year sales<br>

A difficult problem? <br>
Best difficult problem - problem solver as a software programmer, the code I wrote for Amazon online code screen in 2014/ 205, the quality of my code written from 2010 to 2015 first five years. Those crafting skills can not just be acquired by hard working. My difficult problem is to rewrite the website I developed from 2013 to 2015. <br>

Work with marketing and design team. <br>
How to work better? I did work with different designers and learn how to do good research? <br>

Mix css and Java Script and html - take a lot of course pluralsight, and read a few books, start to learn how to work on my crafting skills. <br>
I work on hundred problems on leetcode, hackerrank over 20 contests. <br>

How to make it better? <br>
Pay and ask people to review<br>
Joel - stackexchange CEO - his interview - learn code review website <br>

Communication and work with team members- <br>
Revenue went down, and one time - 10 months after she worked and she got terminated early.<br> 
I understood the business and how things work here.<br> 

Website code written - bug - database - remove an term in website database - this is not difficult. I took one week and allow myself to review adminstration of IIS and review how to troubleshooting.<br>

what is really difficult project to work on? <br>
