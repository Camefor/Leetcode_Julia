**Leetcode algorithms**

Starting from September 3, 2015, I started my first practice on Leetcode algorithms. So far I have practiced over 150 algorithms up to August 15, 2018. 

[Here](https://leetcode.com/jianminchen/) is my Leetcode profile.

I like to motivate myself to practice Leetcode easy level algorithms every day. I started from July 17, in two weeks I practiced and submitted over 35 algorithms.

I know that I have to put a lot of hard work in order to submit 35 algorithms in two weeks. I admire those people submitted more than 1000 sumbission last 12 months, and solved over 500 algorithms on Leetcode.com

Here are my two weeks practice folder:
[July 17 - July 31, 2018](https://github.com/jianminchen/Leetcode_Julia/tree/master/By%20Date/2018%20July%2017%20-%20July%2031%20two%20week%20practice)

Here is the blog I wrote called where to find most hard working people. I like to have some role models and encourage myself to train using Leetcode online judge and a lot of easy level algorithms.

I like to encourage myself to share my practice on Leetcode discussion panel. It is important to share my C# code and write down my practice, highlights of the practice. I like to figure out how I can improve myself in terms of algorithm problem solving. 

The folder is added called [Leetcode discussion](https://github.com/jianminchen/Leetcode_Julia/tree/master/Leetcode%20discussion)

I started to work on medium level algorithms and it is hard to play with medium level algorithms. I have good time to work on coding practice every day. 

I start to set goal from getting interviews or weekly contest ranking to submission count. I admire those player with over 2,000  submissions. I just passed 1,000 submissions mark. I am excited to get used to problem solving, I like to be one of those millions programmer who inspire to be great and hard working programmers. 

I like to write down my feeling and also encourage myself to adapt to medium levle algorithm challenges. Slow is fine but definitely I should push myself forward.

I solve 325 algorithm. I plan to solve 4 medium level tree algorithms, 3 hard level tree algorithms, and solve as many stack medium level algorithms as possible before Dec. 9, 2018. There are 18 medium level stack algorithms. I need to take one code screen before Dec. 9, 2018, and I like to push myself hard to learn through the practice. 

I failed to pass Indeed.com Japan code screen. The code challenges are really tough. It looks like hackerrank platform. <br>

It is also very important for me to practice very often for all classical algorithms. I like to write a page to list all discussion posts I share by timeline. <br>

I can go over my practice and see what are missing in my practice last week or last month. 
[Here](https://github.com/jianminchen/Leetcode_Julia/blob/master/Leetcode%20discussion/2019AlgorithmPractice.md) is the link of 2019 algorithm problems solved.

I like to classify algorithms by categories, like https://github.com/Cappuccinuo/LeetCode. <br> 
[Here](https://github.com/jianminchen/LeetCode-36) is the link to access my forked version on Dec. 20, 2019. <br>
It is important for me to get more oganized. One of ideas is to put algorithms together based on types, like backtracking, graph algorithm, or depth first search. <br>

I wrote my experience on this topic: [Consistent practice advice](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/318537/consistent-practice-advice)<br>

Learning is life long. I am 53 year old and 20 years younger than Donald Trump. Donald chose to compete for US president 6 years ago. I like to work on something exciting as well. 

[Here](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/discuss/655847/my-showcase-of-problem-solving-using-c) is my 236 Lowest common ancestor in binary tree show case. 

What I do is to conintue to learn as an interviewer. I like to explore one classical tree algorithm and then taste how talent people solve them from different angles. Problem solving and crafting skills are amazing to learn and copy from the world toppest talent in the world.

I started slowly to work on Leetcode mock interview day by day, now I just completed more than 4 mock interviews. I learn the importance of training and solve unknown algorithms in limit time. I like to push myself to learn and work on my crafting skills. <br>

I stopped my practice from January to June since I started to be a stock investor, a learner and so scared to go through the market crash and recovery. Holding my 10 years full time saving to play with stock market as an investor. <br>

I got invited to apply Facebook again on June 5, 2020. I decided to start this journey again, and worked on my career since I know that it is so important for me and also business I work for. A person with great crafting skills, hundreds of hours working on foundations should not fail at work. We should put faith in hardwork, sweat, failures, struggles and cheers. <br>

Thank you Facebook Seattle. I will work hard to prepare Facebook phone screen in early July 2020. Stay on the course.

I could not get offer from Google and Facebook in 2020. I like to write down some notes to share with others. It feels much better since I have more experience to share. Hard work makes my life much better in 2020. <br>
